# Main Arguments

## Team Pro-Snowden Argument
 * Spying on allies and foreign companies
 * Activity was later ruled unconstitutional
 * Got people talking about privacy and security
 * Government agents were misusing power to spy on personal friends and acquaintances
 * He watched the director of the NSA allegedly lie to congress, which was his "breaking point"
 * Gained no personal benefit. His USA citizenchip was revoked and is living in Russia.
 * Snowden, in an interview, claimed that the system for reporting problems did not work.
 
## Team Against-Snowden Argument
 * Documents released included NSA locations of US safehouse, drug traffickin records, and other classified material that places people in danger.
 * The intelligence community was doing thier jobs to prevent acts of terror and crime. This was hardly "spying". It was an invasion of privacy to those that were warranting it. 
 
# Rebuttals

## Team Pro-Snowden Counterargunment
 * House intelligence had not publicly released any examples of security being harmed due to the release.
 * Gave information to security resources
 * Snowden alone can not be entirely to blame. One man was given too much access to information.
 * James Clapper has allegedly stated in private that forceasts of harm were seldom borne out.
 * Where does this safehouse claim come from?

## Team Against-Snowden Counterargument
 * Actions could have been handled better internally. 
 * Snowden was never forced to release this information, his own free-will decided he wanted to.
 * The intelligence community was not "spying" on
 * He claims to not have acted for financial gain, yet he writes books to made him money
